Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

``kneejerk`` is a library that accomplishes scoring/using your image data in two steps:

1. Rapid scoring of your images via the Command Line Interface (CLI)
2. Using the file generated by (1) transfer all of the images into a neat directory structure
3. Leverage a tool like ``keras`` to do Data Science Magic

Let's go through these now.

Example Project
----------------

If you want to download and follow along with a simple application of ``kneejerk``, head to `this repository <https://github.com/NapsterInBlue/kneejerk_example>`_, clone it locally, and ``pip install kneejerk``.

After cloning, our project structure looks like

.. code:: none
    
    kneejerk_example
     |
     |--- images
     |      |
     |      |--- bart.jpg
     |      |--- bug_chasing.jpg
     |      |--- bug_fixing.jpg
     |      |
     |      |   ...
     |      |
     |      |---- wack.png
     |--- README.md


Scoring
----------

Now we want to actually score our data.

To do this, we'll leverage the ``kneejerk`` CLI that you got for free as a result of ``pip`` installing the library.

Doing this is as simple as typing ``kneejerk score`` and then populating the following options:


- ``-i``, the location of the directory containing your images, defaulted to wherever you called ``kneejerk`` from
- ``-f``, the name of the resulting ``.csv``, defaulted to ``output.csv``
- ``-o``, the directory to dump the ``.csv`` from the last step. Also defaulted to wherever you called the tool
- ``-s``, shuffle the order that images are served up. Choose between ``0/1``, defaulted to ``0``
- ``--min``, the minimum accepted value you input when scoring, defaulted to ``0``
- ``--max``, the maximum accepted value you input when scoring, defaulted to ``1``


On Our Data
###########

So in our case, if we wanted to launch the tool from the root diectory of ``scratch``, aimed at our images, and dropping a resulting ``.csv`` at the root of the project, we'd use the following:

.. code:: none
    
    $ kneejerk score -i images -o . -f example.csv -s 0


Which will immediately launch a ``matplotlib`` interface that waits for your keyed value for the image.

.. image:: _static/cli_1.PNG
    :width: 600

Pressing your value will immediately log your score, close the current image, and open the next. This repeats until you've gone through the whole input directory.

When this is finished, your project structure will now look like

.. code:: none
    
    kneejerk_example
     |
     |--- images
     |      |
     |      |--- bart.jpg
     |      |--- bug_chasing.jpg
     |      |--- bug_fixing.jpg
     |      |
     |      |   ...
     |      |
     |      |---- wack.png
     |--- README.md
     |--- example.csv


And if we keyed in 9 ``0`` values followed by 9 ``1`` values, we could inspect the resulting ``.csv`` to see that it's of the form ``(filepath, score)``, like so (omitting my full firepath):

.. code:: none

    $ cat example.csv
    kneejerk_workspace\images\bart.jpg,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\bug_chasing.jpg,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\bug_fixing.jpg,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\cool_cat.jpg,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\dating.jpg,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\debug.jpg,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\deep_learning.jpg,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\drake.jpg,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\garbage.png,0
    kneejerk_workspace\images\harry.jpg,1
    kneejerk_workspace\images\honest_work.png,1
    kneejerk_workspace\images\keep_out.jpg,1
    kneejerk_workspace\images\machine_learning.jpg,1
    kneejerk_workspace\images\starbucks.jpg,1
    kneejerk_workspace\images\stash.png,1
    kneejerk_workspace\images\trying_to_sleep.jpg,1
    kneejerk_workspace\images\version_control.png,1
    kneejerk_workspace\images\wack.jpg,1


Loading
-------

In order to make our image data useful for any Machine Learning routine we want to build, we'll need to convert our images to numeric, matrix representations. The ``kneejerk.data.loader`` module handles this neatly.


Generic Data Loading File
#########################

The following file, ``foo.py``, saved and executed from the root directory of your project is all you need to get all of your data loading out of the way and let you get to the fun stuff. Everything after line 3 is merely included for this tutorial.

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    from kneejerk.data.loader import transfer_normalized_image_data

    X, y = transfer_normalized_image_data('example.csv')


    print('Shape of image matrix:', X.shape)
    print('Shape of score matrix:', y.shape)

    print('RGB values of the top-left 5x5 of the first image')
    print(X[0, :5, :5])


Running this yields

.. code:: none

    $ python foo.py
    Max height: 1587
    Max width : 1587
    Shape of image matrix: (3, 200, 200, 3)
    Shape of score matrix: (3,)
    RGB values of the top-left 5x5 of the first image
