``kneejerk`` is a library that accomplishes labeling/using your image data in two steps:

1. Rapid scoring of your images via the Command Line Interface
2. Using the step generated by (1) to load all of your images into a ``numpy.array``.

Let's go through these now.

Example Data
-------------

Suppose you've got a simple directory called ``scratch`` that contains the following images, tucked away in a subdirectory called ``images``

.. image:: _static/bug_fixing.jpg
    :width: 400px

.. image:: _static/deep_learning.jpg
    :width: 400px

.. image:: _static/version_control.png
    :width: 400px

At this point our project structure looks like

.. code:: none
    
    scratch
     |
     |--- images
            |
            |--- bug_fixing.jpg
            |--- deep_learning.jpg
            |---- version_control.png
