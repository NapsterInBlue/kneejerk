# Introduction

Hey there! Thanks for finding your way to this page :)


### Few Quick Notes

`kneejerk` is, wholesale, a little side project I put together to practice packaging and facilitate bigger, funner image-data-based work.

More than happy to hear any thoughts you might have, but would prefer for this to feel more like a hobby than work. To that end, giving this page a quick read is an awesome first step if you're interested in helping out.

### What I'm Looking For

- Any helpful documentation, be it:
    - Tutorials
    - Links to projects that have used `kneejerk` to good/interesting effect
    - Tpyos ;)

- Unit Tests
- Bug Triaging (if any)

### Less Interested In

(Both as a function of knowhow and time, haha)

- Standing this library up as a web service
- Huge API overhauls


# Ground Rules

### Be Excellent to Each Other

As far as all things social/communication go, this project happily adheres to [The Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)

### Code and Workflow

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make **before starting in on the work.** Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- New code won't be accepted until it's submitted via Pull Request with appropriate test coverage
- Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.

-------

That's it for now. Will update this page should the project ever get any traction!
